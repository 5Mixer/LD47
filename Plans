# Plans

 - 100 tracks, ranging in difficulty (Lower level tracks have threshold for maximum car power)
 - Entering a race costs a certain amount
 - Winning a race gives you some money, depending on your place and the race difficulty
 - Online game - the races that are viewable in the world may come from real players
 - Cars continuously race but degrade in speed over time - eventually they no longer become profitable (they always follow same path)
 - Garage UI allows you to buy, repair cars.
